Last Tuesday's 2-0 reverse at Valley Parade

This was Rovers' sixteenth Valentine's Day fixture, the first being a home game with Barrow in 1925.

At first glance, the club's record doesn't look bad.

|  P  |  W  |  D  |  L  | GF  | GA  | Points |  PPG  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|
| 16  |  7  |  5  |  4  | 21  | 15  |   26   | 1.625 |

However, six of those wins game in Rovers first eight Valentine's Day fixtures.

The most recent win came in 2004 - when goals from Ryan Taylor and Iain Hume earned a 2-1 win over Swansea City in the FA Cup fifth round.

(Click play to go straight to Hume's screamer. It's worth it.)

Rovers haven't won a league game on Valentine's Day for 47 years\> The last was a 1-0 victory at Brentford in 1976.

|  P  |  W  |  D  |  L  | GF  | GA  | Points | PPG |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:------:|:---:|
|  6  |  0  |  3  |  3  |  2  |  7  |   3    | 0.5 |

The least romantic Valentine's Day treat? A case can surely be made for the 0-0 draw away at Carlisle United on a Tuesday night in the dying embers of Les Parry's reign.
