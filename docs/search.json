    "text": "1. Rovers forgot how to keep clean sheets on the road\nOne major pitfall is that Rovers’ ability to keep clean sheets on the road deserted them after February 1st.\nMellon faced criticism for being too cautious on the road. But the logic seems sound: Keep a clean sheet and you’re guaranteed to head home with at least one point.\nThe problem is his side forgot how to shut out opposition sides.\nBetween August and January, Rovers kept clean sheets in seven of their 13 games. In other words, they shut out the opposition more often than they conceded.\nBut in the ten games after February 1st, they conceded in nine consecutive games, failing to keep a clean sheet until the 1-0 win at Leyton Orient on the final day of the season, when the play-offs already looked a distant pipe dream."

While Tranmere’s home form remained steady after February 1, their away form nosedived\nAt the end of January, Rovers were picking up an average of 2.14 points from home games and 1.38 from away games.\nBy the end of the season, their home record had remained steady at 2.22 points per game.\nTheir away record, however, plummeted, culminating in an average of 1.04 points-per-game.\nHad Rovers maintained their modest pre-February away record over the course of the season, they would have picked up an extra eight points – enough to achieve an automatic promotion position."

    "text": "3. Rovers conceded too many costly late goals\nTranmere had the second meanest defence in League Two.\nThe problem was not the number of goals they leaked, but when they were conceded.\nRovers conceded 50 percent more goals in the second half of games than in the first.\nMost significantly, analysis shows they had a particularly bad habit of conceding in the final ten minutes of games.\nThose goals tend to prove particularly costly because so little time is left to fight back.\nAnd so it proved in 2021/22.\nThe eight goals conceded in the final ten minutes of games effectively cost Rovers eight points. An extra eight points would have been enought to achieve automatic promotion.\nThis habit fitted the wider trend of the season: It was a bigger problem away from home and it became worse from February onwards.\nIn fact, seven of the eight goals conceded in the final ten minutes occured in games played between February and May."

Rovers paid the price for failing to pick off the division’s worst teams away from home\nWe’ve established that Tranmere’s wretched away form was a major barrier to success.\nBut perhaps the most baffling – and costly – aspect was their inability to pick up points when visiting the worst sides in the division.\nRovers averaged just one point from each of their games against the eight worst sides in the division.\nBottom club Scunthorpe United managed just four wins all season as they meakly succumbed to relegation. To nobody’s surprise, one of those came when Tranmere visited Glanford Park."

    "text": "“Friday night football at Prenton Park returns!” screamed Tranmere Rovers’ official Twitter account last Wednesday.\nSky Sports commentator Rob Palmer captured the mood of many nostalgic Rovers fans. “Brilliant news,” he replied. “Returning to traditions.”\nFriday night football is a curious quirk of Merseyside’s third club.\nWhile the rest of the football pyramid’s weekend fixtures have traditionally kicked off at 3pm on a Saturday, Tranmere became infamous for bucking the trend and hosting games under the Prenton Park floodlights before the weekend had even started.\n“Friday Night is Prenton Night,” as the marketing slogan put it.\nIain St. John and Jimmy Greaves, hosts of ITV’s beloved Saturday football show Saint and Greavsie, tagged Rovers their “Friday night favorites”. Cult band Half Man Half Biscuit even immortalized the tradition in a song, Friday Nights and the Gates are Low.\nAs football writer Jon Allen noted in his recent book, “For most football people, particularly those of a certain generation, Tranmere Rovers means two things: Friday night football and Johnny King and his ‘trip to the moon’.”\nThe association with King is understandable. Many of Rovers’ most celebrated Friday night victories occurred under the legendary’s manager’s stewardship – perhaps most famously the 5-2 mauling of West Ham United in 1992/93, when Rovers looked destined to reach the promised land of the Premier League.\nBut while King took charge of far more Friday league games than any other manager in the club’s history, it is another former gaffer – Dave Russell – that is credited with masterminding the initiative.\nRussell conceived of the idea shortly after arriving from Bury in December 1961.\nHis logic was simple and sound: By avoiding a clash with Rovers’ glamorous neighbors across the River Mersey – Everton and Liverpool – the club might be able to attract more supporters and generate bigger gate receipts.\nThe first such occasion, a 3-1 victory over local rivals Southport on Friday, January 19, 1962, marked the beginning of what would become an institution of Merseyside football culture.\nAt its peak, Rovers played 16 of their 23 home league games on Fridays. That happened in consecutive seasons under Russell – 1965/66 and 1966/67 – and again in 1972/73, when Ron Yeats was in charge.\nThat King would go on to take charge of 136 Friday games during his two spells shows the tradition continued well after Russell departed the Prenton Park hottest in 1969.\nBut Friday Night Football has become something of a novelty in more recent years.\nThirty seasons have now passed since the number of Friday games in a season reached double figures.\nBoth John King and Dave Russell have exceptional records in Friday night matches. King’s sides collected an average of 1.9 points from his 136 games, while Russell managed 1.98 from 96.\nHowever, four managers achieved even better returns.\nMost prolific was Bert Cooke, who won a staggering 2.43 points per game.\nOf course the crucial caveat is that these managers took charge of considerably fewer games than King or Russell.\nThe current manager, Micky Mellon, currently boasts the fourth-best record. The Scot averages an impressive two points-per-game.\nHowever, that equates to a 14 point haul from seven games.\nSadly for Rovers fans, the demise of Friday Night Football means neither Mellon, nor any future manager, will ever get the opportunity to experience anything like as many Friday nights under the lights as their legendary predecessors."
